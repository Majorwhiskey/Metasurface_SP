# Metasurface_SP
The code simulates how an array of antennas on a metasurface receives signals from different angles and with varying noise levels. 
The final goal is to:
1.	Calculate the signal received by the array.
2.	Understand how the direction of arrival (theta and phi) affects the received signal.


Antenna Array and Metasurface:-
1. Antenna Array: A grid of small antennas placed in a pattern (here, a 4x4 grid).
2. Metasurface: A special type of antenna array designed to control how electromagnetic waves behave.
3. Each antenna in the array contributes to the overall received signal, depending on its position and the direction from which the signal comes.


The performance is evaluated using the mean squared error (MSE) and R^2
